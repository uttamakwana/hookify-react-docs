## Getting Started

### 📌 What is hookify-react?

hookify-react is a collection of powerful, reusable React hooks designed to simplify state management, performance optimizations, event handling, and more. Instead of rewriting common logic repeatedly, hookify-react provides well-tested and efficient hooks that enhance development speed and maintainability.

### 🎯 Why Use hookify-react?

React’s built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are great, but real-world applications often require additional functionality like:
✅ **Debouncing** and throttling API calls <br/>
✅ **Managing** local and session storags <br/>
✅ **Handling** event listeners and outside clicks <br/>
✅ **Fetching** data with automatic cachins <br/>
✅ **Tracking** network status and window sizes <br/>

hookify-react solves these challenges with ready-to-use hooks that follow best practices and integrate seamlessly with React.

### 🚀 Benefits of hookify-react
